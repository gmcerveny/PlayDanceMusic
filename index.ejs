                <p>You DJ because you love music.  You've played at parties, in
                  basements, and in your best friend's garage just because dropping
                  fresh tracks is what you do.
                </p>
                <p>You also know DJing is not just about practice and
                  promotion, but digging for new tracks. You've got an
                  ear for new and emerging artists and you're
                  constantly searching for independent producers that
                  are changing the soundtrack.  You know styles
                  change, so you keep your ears open.
                </p>
                <p>Play Dance Music is the first newsletter for you.</p>
