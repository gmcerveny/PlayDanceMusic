          <p>You DJ because you love music.  You've played at parties, in
            basements, and in your best friend's garage just because dropping
            fresh tracks is what you do.

            promotion, but digging for new tracks. You've got an
            ear for new and emerging artists and you're
            constantly searching for independent producers that
            are changing the soundtrack.  You know styles
            change, so you keep your ears open.
