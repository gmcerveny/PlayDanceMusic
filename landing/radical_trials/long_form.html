          <p>Dear Awesome DJs,</p>

          <p>After spending hours searching for tracks, spending hundreds of dollars on records you only play once, and spending many late nights handing out mixtapes and flyers to drunk bastards at the bar...</p>

          <p>It's no surprise you're tired of running this game.</p>

          <p>I'm here to tell you, there is another way.</p>

          <p class="lead">I promise.</p>

          <h3>Myth #1<br/><small>The Only Way to Get Ahead is to Dig More</small></h3>

          <p>Having great tracks is essential to being a DJ, but that doesn't
            mean that's how you should spend all of your time.  You need to be
            practicing and promoting just as much as you need to be digging.
            The good news is, I can help you with all three.</p>

          <h3>Myth #2<br/><small>Getting Gigs is Just About Luck</small></h3>

          <p>Wrong.  Getting gigs is about building a loyal fan base
            and networking with people that run the show.  Signing up to
            Play Dance Music not only gets you connected with the best
            tracks, it also gives you a chance to share your work with a
            community of thousands and meet other awesome DJs.</p>
